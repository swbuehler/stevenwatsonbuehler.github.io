Just random stuff about yours truly&hellip;

* Born and raised in Santa Ana, California.

* Bullied from 2nd grade through graduating high school (with honors).

* Bachelor of Arts _cum laude_ in religion with emphasis in pastoral ministry from [Vanguard University of Southern California](https://vanguard.edu).

* Married in 1998, to somebody I had met in an AOL chat room a year earlier. The first time we met with when we got engaged on New Year's Eve 1998.

* With my then-wife, adopted a son in 2003.

* Lost my $50K/year job to layoffs in 2007.

* Dumped and divorced in 2008. Never saw my adopted son again except in pictures.

* Filed Chapter 7 Bankrupcty in 2009&ndash;2010. 

* Remarried, to my jr. high crush, in 2012.

* Widowed in 2016.

* Currently single (and not really looking).

* Live somewhere around Upper Tampa Bay in Florida.

* Currently play around with data for fun and for a paycheck. I'm an Associate Reporting Analyst specializing in Settlement Solutions data and reporting for [OptumRx Workers Comp and Auto No-Fault](http://workcompauto.optum.com).

* I was diagnosed with Asperger Disorder, Social Anxiety Disorder, and Arrested Development Disorder in 2005 in my 30s, and I take daily medication for the conditions. I like to say that doing so slows the thoughts down so that I can _respond_ to them instead of _react_ to them.

* I have [Hashimoto's thyroiditis](https://www.medicinenet.com/hashimotos_thyroiditis/article.htm) and take daily thyroid hormones. I had taken hormones on and off since 2005 but the diagnosis was actually confirmed through testing in 2018.

* "Flexitarian/Semi-Vegetarian"&mdash;I don't eat meat all that much unless it's in something else, and the only beef I eat is in a fast-food burger. Given the choice I'd rather eat fish or shrimp. It's not because of any concern for animals or such (although I do love living animals), it's just certain textures I can't stand.

* I'm trying to lose weight (I peaked at 245 lbs., trying to get down to ~180. As of this writing I'm at 223.) I use the [Real Appeal](https://realappeal.com) program to keep things on track.

* I'm a closet Myl&egrave;ne Farmer and Rammstein fan.
