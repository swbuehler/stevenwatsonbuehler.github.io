Years ago I got inspired by [John Saddington](http://john.do) to include a colophon on my own site, the reason being that it's kind of fun to see what other people use. So, without further ado&hellip;

## Web tools.

This site runs on the [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) engine, mainly for its simplicity, and is hosted on [Github](https://www.github.com). The content is publicly available in a [dedicated repository](https://github.com/swbuehler/swbuehler.github.io). The theme is based on the same one published by [Fabien Penso](http://blog.penso.info/), which is available in [this repository](https://github.com/penso/blog.penso.info) under an MIT license, and I continue to customize it as I feel like. I can write posts in HTML, Markdown (my preferred style), or Liquid, depending on the need.

Over the last several months I've consolidated everything into a Windows-centric platform (mainly because I play games when I'm bored) and sold off or donated away all my Mac/Apple stuff. I use [Office 365 Personal](https://www.office.com) for most everything (especially Excel, the latest version of which handles JSON input spectacularly using "Get and Transform"), and some [Google Apps Script](https://script.google.com), [IFTTT](https://www.ifttt.com), and [Stringify](https://www.stringify.com) for doing a lot of things automatically. I use [Dash](https://dash.by) to keep track of mileage and vehicle issues. 

At least 90 percent of my social interaction is over [Facebook](https://fb.me/stevenwatsonbuehler), because that's where the people are that I interact with the most. I also post things to [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/stevenwatsonb). I don't use [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com) any more, because it's too much noise.

## Windows Tools.

- [Google Chrome](https://chrome.google.com) for most everything, even though I like how [Microsoft Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/microsoft-edge) integrates with the Photos and other out-of-the-box apps. Since Microsoft [has announced](https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2018/12/06/microsoft-edge-making-the-web-better-through-more-open-source-collaboration/#GmSJg4uFjBM5y8Hz.97) their adoption of the Chromium open-source platform in 2019, eventually Chrome will give way to using Edge full-time. I'm already using Edge on my mobile devices in place of Chrome.

- [Microsoft Office](https://www.office.com) for productivity (2013 at work, 2019+ on Office 365 at home). I like to use Outlook's Connectors to consolidate things into single, easy-to-parse inbox items.

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for editing just about everything, including this site.

- [OneDrive](https://onedrive.live.com) for file storage and backup, included with my Office 365 account, and a [SharePoint Online](https://products.office.com/en-us/sharepoint/collaboration?ms.officeurl=sharepoint&rtc=1) site that I use as an online database and document repository.

- [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org) for most image editing, although most of what I do uses text, for which doing it in PowerPoint and exporting to PNG does the job just as well.

- [Lastpass](https://www.lastpass.com) for password management, and multiform authentication wherever possible. Also on my mobile devices.

- [Spotify Premium](https://www.spotify.com) to feed my music addiction, also on mobile.

## Mobile Tools.

I use Android as my mobile platform, since Windows Phone will be laid to rest toward the end of 2019. I was an Apple fanboi for a while but it's gotten too expensive and increasingly _less_ open. I currently use a Moto G<sup>5S</sup> Plus smartphone and either a Samsung Galaxy Tab A 10.1 tablet with S Pen or an HP Envy Note 5003 Windows tablet with keyboard folio depending on the intended use. Eventually I want to replace both with a Surface Go.  I've also got an original Acer Chromebook 11 that's nearing end of support. There's also an Alcatel IDOL 4S w/ Windows 10 around somewhere because I simply can't let go of it.

- [Microsoft Launcher](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microsoft.launcher) for my home screen. 

- [Outlook](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microsoft.office.outlook) for email, schedules, contacts, etc.

- [Word](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microsoft.office.word), [Excel](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microsoft.office.excel), and [PowerPoint](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microsoft.office.powerpoint), just because they were preinstalled on the tablet.

- [Edge](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microsoft.emmx) for web browsing (in reality, it's Chrome with a Microsoft overlay).

- The usual array of social apps: Facebook, Instagram, TikTok&hellip; (the latter because I need a good laugh).

## Hardware/Analog Tools.

- A disc-bound notebook, currently [Staples ARC](https://www.staples.com/deals/Staples-Arc/BI1414809) because it's the easiest to find, although Office Depot, Levenger, and Rollabind all produce the same product. I prefer Levenger's punches, though, because they have a slightly deeper punch that lets the pages turn more freely.  I keep a paper calendar in it as a backup for my digital one, and I can punch and insert appointment cards and notes as reminders.  Typically anything that comes to me on paper is scanned to digital as quickly as possible. 

- A couple of digital pens&mdash;A [LiveScribe 3](https://www.livescribe.com) and a first-generation [Equil Smartpen](https://www.myequil.com/home/). Don't use either of them very much.

- PaperMate InkJoy gel pens. 0.5mm if I can find them.

- [Alienware](https://www.alienware.com) 15 R3 gaming laptop for the obvious, with an attached 27&Prime; external display.

- Apple Earpods, the only piece of Apple hardware I did _not_ give up apart from a very old iPod Nano.

- The aforementioned Acer Chromebook 11 (CB3-111) that's approaching end of support.

- The aforementioned HP Envy Note 8&Prime Windows tablet with a Lenovo active pen and keyboard folio.

- A brother DSMobile 920DW mobile duplex scanner and an HP OfficeJet Pro 8600 Plus for going paperless, although I'm using my phone's camera more often for the same purpose.

- A Raspberry Pi 3B+ microserver for automating and testing things out.

- An '09 smart fortwo passion coup√© for getting from A to B, with a bluetooth OBD adapter feeding data to the Dash app on my phone.
