Years ago I got inspired by [John Saddington](http://john.do) to include a colophon on my own site, the reason being that it's kind of fun to see what other people use. So, without further ado&hellip;

## Web tools.

This site runs on the [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) engine, mainly for its simplicity with page editing, and is hosted on [Github](https://www.github.com). The content is publicly available in a [dedicated repository](https://github.com/swbuehler/swbuehler.github.io). The theme is based on "Simple" by wildflame; you can find out more using the link in the footer below. I've modified the styles slightly but it's otherwise pretty much off-the-shelf.

I use [Office 365 Personal](https://www.office.com) and Apple's iWork apps (Pages, Numbers, Keynote) and a <del>small</del> 2-terabyte iCloud account for most everything (especially Excel, the latest version of which handles JSON input spectacularly using "Get and Transform"), and some [Google Apps Script](https://script.google.com), [IFTTT](https://www.ifttt.com), and [Stringify](https://www.stringify.com) for doing a lot of things automatically. I use [Dash](https://dash.by) to keep track of mileage and vehicle issues. Starting to play around with iOS' [Shortcuts](https://support.apple.com/guide/shortcuts/welcome/ios) app for some on-the-fly stuff as well.

At least 90 percent of my social interaction is over [Facebook](https://fb.me/stevenwatsonbuehler), because that's where the people are that I interact with the most. I also post things to [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/stevenwatsonb). <del>I don't use [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com) any more, because it's too much noise.</del> I signed back up for Twitter, but it'll probably just be automated notifications.
