title: Colophon

Years ago I got inspired by [John Saddington](http://john.do) to include a colophon on my own site, the reason being that it's kind of fun to see what other people use. So, without further ado&hellip;

## Web tools.

This site runs on the [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) engine, mainly for its simplicity with page editing, and is hosted on [Github](https://www.github.com). The content is publicly available in a [dedicated repository](https://github.com/swbuehler/swbuehler.github.io). The theme is based on "Simple" by wildflame; you can find out more using the link in the footer below. I've modified the styles slightly but it's otherwise pretty much off-the-shelf.

I use [Office 365 Personal](https://www.office.com) and a small iCloud account for most everything (especially Excel, the latest version of which handles JSON input spectacularly using "Get and Transform"), and some [Google Apps Script](https://script.google.com), [IFTTT](https://www.ifttt.com), and [Stringify](https://www.stringify.com) for doing a lot of things automatically. I use [Dash](https://dash.by) to keep track of mileage and vehicle issues. Starting to play around with iOS' [Shortcuts](https://support.apple.com/guide/shortcuts/welcome/ios) app for some on-the-fly stuff as well.

At least 90 percent of my social interaction is over [Facebook](https://fb.me/stevenwatsonbuehler), because that's where the people are that I interact with the most. I also post things to [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/stevenwatsonb). <del>I don't use [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com) any more, because it's too much noise.</del> I signed back up for Twitter, but it'll probably most be automated notifications.

## Windows Tools.

- [Google Chrome](https://chrome.google.com) for most everything, even though I like how [Microsoft Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/microsoft-edge) integrates with the Photos and other out-of-the-box apps. Since Microsoft [has announced](https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2018/12/06/microsoft-edge-making-the-web-better-through-more-open-source-collaboration/#GmSJg4uFjBM5y8Hz.97) their adoption of the Chromium open-source platform in 2019, eventually Chrome will give way to using Edge full-time. I'm already using Edge on my mobile devices in place of Chrome.

- [Microsoft Office](https://www.office.com) for productivity (2013 at work, 2019+ on Office 365 at home). I like to use Outlook's Connectors to consolidate things into single, easy-to-parse inbox items.

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for editing just about everything, including this site.

- [Corel VideoStudio Ultimate](https://www.videostudiopro.com/en/products/videostudio/?hptrack=en2bb5) for video editing (along with the built-in Photos video editor in a pinch).

- [OneDrive](https://onedrive.live.com) for file storage and backup, included with my Office 365 account, and a [SharePoint Online](https://products.office.com/en-us/sharepoint/collaboration?ms.officeurl=sharepoint&rtc=1) site that I use as an online database and document repository.

- [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org) for most image editing, although most of what I do uses text, for which doing it in PowerPoint and exporting to PNG does the job just as well.

- [Lastpass](https://www.lastpass.com) for password management, and multiform authentication wherever possible. Also on my mobile devices.

- [Apple Music](https://www.apple.com/itunes/) to feed my music addiction, also on mobile.

## Mac Tools.

I have a VMWare virtual machine running a basic macOS Mojave install to manage data on my iPhone, and because Photos is still the best media organizer around (IMHO). Because it's not Apple hardware, I can't use it for Messages or Facetime; and because it's VMWare, anything requiring video acceleration (Maps, iMovie) just gives me a black screen. Eventually I'll have a real Mac. 

## Mobile Tools.

- iPhone 6S (never had the need to upgrade).

- iPad (6th Generation, with an Apple Pencil).

- The usual array of social apps: [Facebook](https://facebook.com), [Instagram](https://instagram.com), [TikTok](https://tiktok.com)&hellip; (the latter because I need a good laugh).

- [Adobe Scan](https://acrobat.adobe.com/us/en/mobile/scanner-app.html) for scanning and converting documents, receipts, appointment cards, &c.

## Hardware/Analog Tools.

- A disc-bound notebook, currently [Staples ARC](https://www.staples.com/deals/Staples-Arc/BI1414809) because it's the easiest to find, although Office Depot, Levenger, and Rollabind all produce the same product. I prefer Levenger's punches, though, because they have a slightly deeper punch that lets the pages turn more freely.  I keep a paper calendar in it as a backup for my digital one, and I can punch and insert appointment cards and notes as reminders.  Typically anything that comes to me on paper is scanned to digital as quickly as possible. 

- A couple of digital pens&mdash;A [LiveScribe 3](https://www.livescribe.com) and a first-generation [Equil Smartpen](https://www.myequil.com/home/). Don't use either of them very much.

- PaperMate InkJoy gel pens. 0.5mm if I can find them.

- [Alienware](https://www.alienware.com) 15 R3 gaming laptop for the obvious, with an attached 27&Prime; external display.

- Apple [Earpods](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MNHF2AM/A/earpods-with-35-mm-headphone-plug?fnode=67f3fe5f8e47681d909832e8332a9386d53eddd3850b1d1d9f8251b25ada413d7ff6f17959d41cd5fd7f61bf3e082a7541aed6aa96bc360633a65efb90cf9a4315f29fd5af3ae80f3f68772327f2d9f5b163719d99806d7f251538b4d4a4fe1f); somehow I've ended up with several of them.

- The aforementioned Acer Chromebook 11 (CB3-111) that's approaching end of support.

- The aforementioned [HP Envy 8 Note Model 5003](https://support.hp.com/us-en/product/HP-ENVY-8-Note-Tablet/8744686/model/9082829) Windows tablet with a [Lenovo active pen](https://support.lenovo.com/us/en/accessories/acc100285) (because I lost the HP one) and keyboard folio (Model 5002 doesn't include the keyboard folio and pen).

- A brother [DSMobile 920DW](https://www.brother-usa.com/products/ds920dw) mobile duplex scanner and an [HP OfficeJet Pro 8600 Plus](https://support.hp.com/us-en/product/hp-officejet-pro-8600-plus-e-all-in-one-printer-series-n911/4322915) for going paperless, although I'm using my phone's camera more often for the same purpose.

- <del>A Raspberry Pi 3B+ microserver for automating and testing things out.</del>

- An ['09 smart fortwo passion coup√©](https://www.msn.com/en-us/autos/smart/fortwo/2009/sd-AAbLhrv) for getting from A to B, with a bluetooth OBD adapter feeding data to the [Dash](https://dash.by) app on my phone.
