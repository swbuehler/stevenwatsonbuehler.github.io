Years ago I got inspired by [John Saddington](http://john.do) to include a colophon on my own site, the reason being that it's kind of fun to see what other people use. So, without further ado&hellip;

## Web tools.

This site runs on the [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) engine, mainly for its simplicity with page editing, and is hosted on [Github](https://www.github.com). The content is publicly available in a [dedicated repository](https://github.com/swbuehler/swbuehler.github.io). The theme is based on "Simple" by wildflame; you can find out more using the link in the footer below. I've modified the styles slightly but it's otherwise pretty much off-the-shelf.

I use [Office 365 Personal](https://www.office.com) and Apple's iWork apps (Pages, Numbers, Keynote) and a <del>small</del> 2-terabyte iCloud account for most everything (especially Excel, the latest version of which handles JSON input spectacularly using "Get and Transform"), and some [Google Apps Script](https://script.google.com), [IFTTT](https://www.ifttt.com), and [Stringify](https://www.stringify.com) for doing a lot of things automatically. I use [Dash](https://dash.by) to keep track of mileage and vehicle issues. Starting to play around with iOS' [Shortcuts](https://support.apple.com/guide/shortcuts/welcome/ios) app for some on-the-fly stuff as well.

At least 90 percent of my social interaction is over [Facebook](https://fb.me/stevenwatsonbuehler), because that's where the people are that I interact with the most. I also post things to [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/stevenwatsonb). <del>I don't use [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com) any more, because it's too much noise.</del> I signed back up for Twitter, but it'll probably just be automated notifications.

## Windows Tools.

My main machine is an [Alienware](https://www.alienware.com) 15 R3 gaming laptop that was given to me by a friend when my MSI Apache Pro machine kicked the bucket. It holds an Intel Core i7-7600HQ CPU and an Nvidia GeForce GTX 1070 GPU, along with 16GB of RAM. It _flies_. Connected to it is a 27&Prime; ASUS 1920&times;1080 LCD display. I use a different machine for work (a very thin 13&Prime; HP Elitebook with 16GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD, provided by my employer).

I've got a few Windows-based tablets as well, but I've been converting them into Linux ones as they become obsolete. Among them are an HP Envy 8 Note with Keyboard Folio and Active Pen, a Dell Venue 8 Pro, and an Acer S1002 10&Prime; 2-in-1.

- <del>[Google Chrome](https://chrome.google.com)</del> [Opera](https://www.opera.com), which uses the same codebase as Google Chrome, for most everything, even though I like how [Microsoft Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/microsoft-edge) integrates with the Photos and other out-of-the-box apps. Since Microsoft [has announced](https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2018/12/06/microsoft-edge-making-the-web-better-through-more-open-source-collaboration/#GmSJg4uFjBM5y8Hz.97) their adoption of the Chromium open-source platform in 2019, eventually that will give way to using Edge full-time with Windows.

- [Microsoft Office](https://www.office.com) for productivity (2013 at work, 2019+ on Office 365 at home). I like to use Outlook's Connectors to consolidate things into single, easy-to-parse inbox items.

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for editing just about everything, including this site.

- [Corel VideoStudio Ultimate](https://www.videostudiopro.com/en/products/videostudio/?hptrack=en2bb5) for video editing (along with the built-in Photos video editor in a pinch). Lately, though, I've just been using iMovie on my mobile devices.

- [OneDrive](https://onedrive.live.com) for file storage and backup, included with my Office 365 account, and a [SharePoint Online](https://products.office.com/en-us/sharepoint/collaboration?ms.officeurl=sharepoint&rtc=1) site that I use as an online database and document repository. Slowly migrating things over to iCloud.

- [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org) for most image editing, although most of what I do uses text, for which doing it in PowerPoint or Keynote and exporting to PNG does the job just as well.

- [Lastpass](https://www.lastpass.com) for password management, and multiform authentication wherever possible. Also on my mobile devices.

- [Apple Music](https://www.apple.com/itunes/) to feed my music addiction, also on mobile.

## Mac Tools.

I have a VMWare virtual machine running a basic macOS Mojave install to manage data on my iPhone, and because Photos is still the best media organizer around (IMHO). Because it's not Apple hardware, I can't use it for Messages or Facetime; and because it's VMWare, anything requiring video acceleration (Maps, iMovie) just gives me a black screen. Eventually I'll have a real Mac. 

## Mobile Tools.

- [iPhone](https://www.apple.com/iphone) 6S (never felt the need to upgrade, but an XR might be in my future), with an iPhone SE as a backup.

- [iPad](https://www.apple.com/ipad), 6th generation, with a first-generation [Apple Pencil](https://www.apple.com/apple-pencil/) (the second-generation Pencil is specifically for the newest iPad Pro, because it uses wireless charging that the base iPad doesn't have).

- The usual array of social apps: [Facebook](https://facebook.com), [Instagram](https://instagram.com), [TikTok](https://tiktok.com) (because I need a good laugh), and very limited use of [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com).

- A Brother [DSMobile 920DW](https://www.brother-usa.com/products/ds920dw) mobile duplex scanner for going paperless; it stores scans as JPG or PDF to an SD card that I import into my iPhone or iPad with a [Lightning to SD Card Reader](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MJYT2AM/A/lightning-to-sd-card-camera-reader), and then send the images to [Adobe Scan](https://acrobat.adobe.com/us/en/mobile/scanner-app.html) to convert to searchable PDFs. It also has a USB port for charging or for scanning directly to a PC or Mac. I also own an [HP OfficeJet Pro 8600](https://support.hp.com/us-en/product/HP-Officejet-Pro-8600-e-All-in-One-Printer-series---N911/4322914/model/4323658)[^1], but I find myself using the DSMobile far more often and I don't do a whole lot of printing. I keep it because it prints automatic duplex, which saves on paper. A set of the more expensive "XL" ink cartridges lasts me well over a year (my black one has lasted almost two).

## Analog Tools.

I like using disc-bound binders like the [Arc](https://www.staples.com/deals/Staples-Arc/BI1414809) system from Staples. There are also the [Circa](https://www.levenger.com/CIRCA-326.aspx) system from Levenger and [T&#x016A;L](https://www.officedepot.com/a/products/864269/TUL-Custom-Note-Taking-System-Discbound/)&trade; from Office Depot/OfficeMax&mdash;they're all compatible with each other (Levenger is the "luxury" leather brand). Along with a [portable punch](https://www.levenger.com/circa-326/circa-discs-punches-1008/circa-1-2-3-portable-punch-8704.aspx), it lets me keep just about anything dead-tree-based of any size in one place (I do like Levenger's punches best because they have a slightly better depth that lets the pages turn more freely). For example, I can put my appointment cards in my paper calendar for that week rather than having to write it down. I use [D.I.Y. Calendar](http://diyplanner.com)'s Dynamic Template tool to print up my weekly calendars for each year in a Moleskine-style two-page-weekly format (week on the left, notes on the right).

And yes, I do keep a written calendar as a backup to my digital one. 

I have multiple hardbound notebooks&mdash;[Moleskine](https://us.moleskine.com/en/), [Leuchtturm1917](https://www.leuchtturm1917.us), [LiveScribe](http://www.livescribe.com/site/)&mdash;but ultimately everything ends up in a digital form, either scanned or snapped with my phone and made searchable. I'm also using [OneNote](https://www.onenote.com) or Apple Notes with my iPad and Apple Pencil more often.

I'm a huge fan of [PaperMate's Ink Joy](http://inkjoy.papermate.com) gel pens (they won me over from Pilot G-2s), preferably in 0.5mm line width when I can find them (most retailers only have the 0.7mm variety). I also have somewhat of a fetish for fountain pens (a [Pilot MR Metropolitan](https://www.pilotpen.us/categories/fountain-pens/mr-metropolitan-fountain-pen/) currently is my go-to, as well as some [Pilot Varsity](http://pilotpen.us/brands/varsity/varsity/) disposable ones in various colors), because they force me to write _neatly_.

So what do you use?
