- I'm a "late-40-something" with high-functioning autism living on my own around Tampa Bay in Florida. I was diagnosed in 2005.

- I have loved and lost twice&mdash;dumped and divorced the first time, quite abruptly widowed the second time.

- I grew up in Santa Ana, California, and moved to Florida in the middle of 2000 (literally; I arrived here on July 1, 2000).

- I'm a shameless theme park wanderer. [Walt Disney World](https://www.waltdisneyworld.com), [Busch Gardens Tampa Bay](https://buschgardens.com/tampa), and [SeaWorld Orlando](https://seaworld.com/orlando) are my playgrounds.

- My car is called the `#doombuggy`. It's a black and silver [Smart fortwo](https://www.smartusa.com) that's not much larger than Disney's "doom buggy" Omnimover vehicles inside "The Haunted Mansion" and its offspring.

- My car is also temporarily called the `#weedmobile`, because the expiration sticker reads "04-20". 

- I work full-time as a Data/Reporting Analyst (see my [Disclosures](/disclosures.md)). I play with data for a living as well as for fun.

- I play games on PC, Xbox One&trade;, and Nintendo Switch&trade;.

- I broadcast my gameplay on [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/doombuggygames), [Mixer](https://mixer.com/doombuggygames), YouTube, [Mobcrush](https://www.mobcrush.com/doombuggygames), and [Facebook Gaming](https://gaming.facebook.com/DoombuggyGames).

- I'm a [musician](https://soundcloud.com/inmysilence).
