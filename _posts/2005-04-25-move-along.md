So here I am, starting over with a new blog. Eventually I'll get some of the old material back in here, but what is this about, really? 

I suppose it's about geekery. About [code](https://gist.github.com/swbuehler). About [gaming](https://fb.gg/doombuggygames). About [music](https://soundcloud.com/inmysilence). About life in general.

Enjoy, and stay tuned for more. In the meantime, you can read how I put this together in the [colophon](/colophon).
