Since the beginning of <a href="http://4push.com">Push 4.0</a>, more than
60,000 users have taken on the app and many of you rated it as 4/5. It
currently delivers 400,000 pushes every single day of the year.

It's now time to move on with a better iOS 7 app. The new one is so much
better, it deserved a new name. Welcome <a href="http://faast.io">Faast</a>, my
new Push iOS application.

Expect a complete rewrite from scratch, with tons of new features and a lot of
cares on the reading experience. Follow <a
