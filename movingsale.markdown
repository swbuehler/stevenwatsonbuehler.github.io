# Music CDs

I have an extensive collection of music CDs in both French and English. Since I now use a music service (Apple Music), I haven't touched most of them in years. List is forthcoming.

# Books

I have a small selection of books (mostly biblical studies/religious material) that I no longer use. I'll have a list up shortly.

Among those books is the complete New Testament set of _The Complete Biblical Library_, which contains an interlinear English-Greek New Testament with full grammatical parsing, verse-by-verse commentary, manuscript variants, &c., and a English-Greek Lexicon fully keyed to the text. The Lexicon is also keyed to the Old Testament set (which I do not have). Volume One is a chronological parallel gospels. It was an indispensible tool in bible college! **_$400 takes all 16 volumes_** (a substantial portion of which will be shipping it to you if you are not picking up locally).

# Furniture

Furniture requires local pickup, as obviously I can't load it onto a Smart fortwo and drive it to you. Pictures are forthcoming.

- Couch and love seat, burgundy velvet-type material. Couch has some darker spots because the late wife used it as a bed for her last couple of years and we like to wear black.

- Bedroom dresser

- Bedside 3-drawer nightstands (2)

# Appliances

- LG 32-inch LCD TV (2)
